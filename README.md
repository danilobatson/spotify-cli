# BuildBook Coding Exercise

## Overview
A command line console using MongoDB consisting of `songs`, `users`, and `playlists`.

## Instructions

 * Run clone the repo and run `npm i` in the terminal
 * Please make sure you have the highest version of node installed other wise you can download by  [visiting](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
 * Once installed you may do a few commands in your terminal
 * If you visit the `commands.js` file you may see possible commands
 * Commands include `node command.js add`, `node command.js find <name>`, and `node command.js delete`. Scripts have been added for shorthand of these commands.

## Other Things Of Note
 * Prompt questions were added for ease of user
 * Your solution includes a README that explains how to use your application and a way to validate its output.
 * About three hours was spent on this project which also consisted of reading a lot of the Mongoose documentation.
 * This project may qualify as something that executes but is functionally incomplete. It does not create a new file but will log results to the console. Open to discussing alternatives. You may also see my [portfolio](https://danilobatson.github.io/portfolio/) that displays my extensive work in React an React Native
 * For scale this project would need to be on a database where we could make request to an API as opposed to my local connection. Folder structure of models, schema, and commands would need to be broken up appropriately. Currently we have a long file with much more code than I usually have on any one file.
